The following CSS rule has an unusual issue: `background: url(image.png) no-repeat;`. The `no-repeat` value is intended to prevent the background image from repeating, but in certain browsers or scenarios, it might not work as expected, resulting in the image repeating unexpectedly or not displaying at all.  This can be due to various factors like incorrect image path or cache issues.
