# CSS Background Image `no-repeat` Issue
This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with the CSS `background-image` property and the `no-repeat` keyword. In some instances, the image might still repeat despite setting the value to `no-repeat`. This often happens due to browser inconsistencies or problems with caching.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and `solution.css` offers a few potential solutions.

## Potential Solutions:

1. **Verify Image Path:** Double-check the path to your image file to ensure it's correct. Minor typos can break the functionality.
2. **Explicit Width and Height:** Setting explicit values for `background-size: contain;` or `background-size: cover;` can influence how the image is rendered and often helps override repeat issues.
3. **Caching Issues:** Clearing browser cache and hard-refreshing the page could resolve inconsistencies.
4. **Specificity:** Ensure the CSS rule is applied with sufficient specificity to avoid unintended overrides by other styles.
